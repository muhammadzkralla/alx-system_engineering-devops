Issue Summary:

Duration: The issue occurred during testing on April 15, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM UTC.
Impact: The bug affected the functionality of the Android HTTP client library, preventing it from making requests when testing. It caused confusion and delays in the development process.
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a lack of internet connectivity during testing, which led to the failure of HTTP requests.
Timeline:

2:00 PM UTC: The issue was detected while testing the Android HTTP client library, as no network requests were being made successfully.
2:05 PM UTC: Engineers began investigating the issue by reviewing code changes and debugging the testing environment.
2:10 PM UTC: Initial investigations focused on code logic and configuration settings related to network requests but did not reveal any anomalies.
2:15 PM UTC: Further analysis of the testing environment revealed that the device was not connected to the internet.
2:20 PM UTC: The incident was escalated to the testing team to confirm the lack of internet connectivity and its impact on the issue.
2:25 PM UTC: Upon confirming the lack of internet connectivity, the device was connected to the internet, and testing was resumed.
2:30 PM UTC: Normal testing operations resumed, and HTTP requests were successfully made, indicating the resolution of the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was the absence of internet connectivity during testing, resulting in the failure of HTTP requests made by the Android HTTP client library.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by connecting the testing device to the internet, allowing the HTTP client library to make requests successfully.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance testing procedures to include checks for internet connectivity before conducting network-related tests.
Implement logging and error handling mechanisms to provide clearer indications of network-related issues during testing.
Tasks:
Update testing documentation to include prerequisites for network-related tests, emphasizing the importance of internet connectivity.
Conduct training sessions for developers and testers on identifying and troubleshooting network-related issues in testing environments.
